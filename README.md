Q: What is machine learning?
    Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and improve their performance on a specific task over time.

Unhelpful Answers:
1. Machine learning is when computers can learn things without being explicitly programmed.
2. Machine learning is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from examples.
3. Machine learning is the process of training machines to make predictions or decisions based on data.

Q: What is multilayer perceptron?
    A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, with each node receiving input from and sending output to other nodes in the same layer, as well as from the previous and next layers. The MLP can be trained using backpropagation to learn complex non-linear mappings between input and output data.

llama_print_timings:      sample time =    66.25 ms /    85 runs   (    0.78 ms per token,  1282.98 tokens per second)

Q: What is supervised learning?

Llama.generate: prefix-match hit

    Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs, so that the model can make predictions on new, unseen data. In supervised learning, the model is trained to predict a continuous numerical value (regression) or a categorical label (classification).

llama_print_timings:        load time = 19715.92 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =    27.48 ms /    74 runs   (    0.37 ms per token,  2692.97 tokens per second)
