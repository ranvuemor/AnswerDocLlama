Q: What is machine learning?
 Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and improve their performance on a specific task over time.

Unhelpful Answers:
1. Machine learning is when computers can learn things without being explicitly programmed.
2. Machine learning is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from examples.
3. Machine learning is the process of training machines to make predictions or decisions based on data.
